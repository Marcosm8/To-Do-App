A new Flutter project.
=======
# To-Do-App
Small smartphone app built in Flutter/Dart

Simple app built using Flutter. Will use this repo as practice to learn the fundamentals of making a full stack application. No long term vision for now. I expect this app this morph and evolve past a simple "to-do" app. If an idea strikes, I will try to implement it here.
